This file contains the username and password for your academic
mysql database. Please note that your group php space is under quota
restrictions. To view your quota, run the following command:

	quota -v -g -u

This quota is in Kilobytes. Quota increases are only possible via
approval from the professor in your class. To have your quota increased,
your professor must send a request to helpdesk@cc.gatech.edu with your
group name, the amount of quota to add, and the reason for the
quota increase.


Your mysql database is accessible via the mysql client located on this
server, via your software application using MySQL libraries, or
via phpMyAdmin, located at:

	https://academic-mysql.cc.gatech.edu/phpmyadmin

You will need to provide your GT username and password, and then your
database username and password to phpMyAdmin

Also, since this php space is for groupwork, make sure to set group write
permissions for all files in your group's web folder by either running:

	umask 002

before adding or editing files, or using:

chmod g+w <file name>

after adding or editing files

To access your database, use the following username and password:

	Username: cs4400_Team_13
	Password: ewoyfHEG
